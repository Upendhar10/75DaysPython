# DAY-2: PIP and MODULES 

## Modules 

- Module is like a code library that can be used to borrow code written by somebody else in our Python program. 
There are two types of modules in Python:
    1. Built-in Modules 
        - These modules are ready to import use and ship with the Python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly.
    2. External Modules 
        - These modules are imported from a third-party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. 
        Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of the same module with time.


## The pip command
    
- It can be used as a package manager pip to install a Python module. 
- Let's install a module called pandas using the following command

      command :  pip install pandas

- Using a module in Python (Usage)
- We use the import syntax to import a module in Python. Here is an example code:

      command : import pandas
 
- Similarly, we can install other modules and look into their documentation for usage instructions in the same way.
